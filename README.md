### Epidemiology, data science and mental health

I am a research fellow in the Division of Psychiatry at UCL. My research interests include the physical health of people with severe mental illness and the repurposing of physical health pharmacological treatments to improve mental health outcomes.

I am interested in the use of causal inference to better quantify outcomes, but also in the use of elegant descriptive epidemiology to support causal inference and inform service decisions.

I prefer to work in R, but do at times also work in Stata. 

This repository is currently under development. I aim to document key components of my code and code lists.
